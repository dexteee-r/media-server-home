## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-28

### 🎯 **MAJOR RELEASE: Architecture 2 Machines**

Complete infrastructure redesign with physical separation EXTRANET/INTRANET.

### Added

#### Architecture
- **Machine #1 (EXTRANET):** Dell OptiPlex 7040 as DMZ node
  - Nginx Proxy Manager (reverse proxy + Let's Encrypt)
  - OpenVPN Access Server (remote access)
  - ddclient (dynamic DNS for elmzn.be)
  - Fail2ban (bruteforce protection)
  - Uptime Kuma (uptime monitoring)
  
- **Machine #2 (INTRANET):** Custom PC as storage + compute node
  - Immich (4TB photo storage)
  - Nextcloud (file sharing + sync)
  - PostgreSQL 16 (database)
  - Redis 7 (cache)
  - Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring)
  - VM-DEV-LINUX (Ubuntu/Debian lab)
  - VM-DEV-WINDOWS (Windows 10/11 lab)

#### Documentation
- `docs/ADR/011-architecture-2-machines.md` - Architecture decision record
- `docs/ADR/012-separation-extranet-intranet.md` - Security separation rationale
- `README.md` - Complete rewrite for dual-machine setup
- `docs/SETUP-MACHINE1.md` - Machine #1 installation guide
- `docs/SETUP-MACHINE2.md` - Machine #2 installation guide
- `docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Migration from 1 to 2 machines

#### Configuration
- `configs/machine1-extranet/docker-compose.yml` - EXTRANET services stack
- `configs/machine2-intranet/docker-compose.yml` - INTRANET services stack
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

#### Scripts
- `scripts/backup-m2-to-m1.sh` - Automated Restic backup (M2 → M1)
- `scripts/setup-machine1.sh` - Machine #1 automated setup
- `scripts/setup-machine2.sh` - Machine #2 automated setup

#### Security
- Defense in Depth: 6-layer security model
  1. ISP router firewall
  2. Proxmox datacenter firewall
  3. UFW on Machine #1 (public ports only)
  4. UFW on Machine #2 (LAN + M1 only)
  5. Fail2ban (auto-ban bruteforce)
  6. Application-level authentication

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes
- **IP Addressing:**
  - Machine #1 (EXTRANET): `192.168.1.111` (was `192.168.1.100`)
  - Machine #2 (INTRANET): `192.168.1.101` (new)
  - Proxmox host no longer exposed on `.100`

- **Service Architecture:**
  - Services now split across 2 physical machines
  - Machine #2 NEVER exposed directly to Internet
  - All external access via reverse proxy (M1) or VPN

- **Storage:**
  - Media/photos now on Machine #2 (4TB HDD ZFS)
  - Backups now M2 → M1 (was local only)

#### Performance
- CPU allocation optimized:
  - Machine #1: i5-6500 (4T) dedicated reverse proxy
  - Machine #2: i7-6700 (8T) for apps + VMs
- RAM allocation:
  - Machine #1: 6 GB for EXTRANET VM
  - Machine #2: 16 GB (6 GB INTRANET + 8 GB VMs lab)

### Removed

- Single-machine architecture (deprecated)
- Traefik reverse proxy (replaced by Nginx Proxy Manager)
- Jellyfin streaming (postponed to future release)
- Local media on Machine #1 (migrated to Machine #2)

### Fixed

- Security: Eliminated direct Internet exposure of application services
- Performance: Reduced CPU contention (separated workloads)
- Scalability: Infrastructure ready for future expansion

### Security

- **CVE Mitigations:**
  - No services directly exposed to Internet (except reverse proxy)
  - Fail2ban active on all public ports
  - VPN required for admin access (Proxmox, Grafana)
  
- **Hardening:**
  - UFW restrictive rules on both machines
  - SSH key-only authentication (passwords disabled)
  - Automated security updates enabled
  - Regular backup testing (quarterly)
